# Random Tree Supervised Classification Analysis

#### Here is what the supervised classification looks like

![Random Tree Classification, 2018 to 2024 @GTMNERR St. Augustine, Florida](assets/RTClassification.jpg)

#### To analyze this data, I will create a chord diagram using the classification results.
```{r}
# Setup Working Directory and install necessary packages
setwd("C:/Users/tuj48066/OneDrive - Temple University/Desktop/Rfiles/Intro to R/workflowr")
library(pacman)
library(readr)
p_load(chorddiag, htmlwidgets, tidyverse, igraph, readr, tidygraph, Matrix)

# Read in data and select columns needed for chord diagram
GTMChange <- read_csv("data/GTMChange2018to2024.csv") %>%
  select(GTM2018 = Class_From, GTM2024 = Class_To, SquareKM)

# Create a matrix dataframe
matrixgtm <- as.matrix(as_adjacency_matrix(as_tbl_graph(GTMChange),
                                            attr = "SquareKM"))
# Transpose the data frame (it was originally backward)
matrixgtm <- t(matrixgtm)

# Select colors for the chord diagram
groupColors <-c( "#7db7c7", # Water
                 "#56bf5f", # Marsh
                 "#1d4220", # Mangrove
                 "#6e4f1e", # Mudflat
                 "#b0af9e" # developed
)
# make chord diagram ------
chord<-chorddiag(data = matrixgtm,
                 type = "bipartite",
                 groupColors = groupColors,
                 groupnamePadding = 10,
                 groupPadding = 3,
                 groupnameFontsize = 12 ,
                 showTicks = FALSE,
                 margin=130,
                 tooltipGroupConnector = "    &#x25B6;    ",
                 chordedgeColor = "#363533"
)

chord
```
The left side of the circle represents land types from the year 2018, the right side of the circle represents land types from the year 2024.

## Big takeaways from these findings are

Total net marsh loss due to (what we suspect is) sea level-rise/erosion (Between 2018-2024)

0.722km2.

Total net Mangrove loss due to (what we suspect is) sea level-rise/erosion (Between 2018-2024)

<0.01km2

Area of marshland colonized by mangroves (Between 2018-2024)

0.392km2




## Results compared to LandFire data

#### These results were filtered to show significant habitat type change (>1000 acre change) that occurred in the study region.

#### One of the more significant findings from this landfire analysis is that the riparian habitat has been heavily changed into differing habitats such as conifer and hardwood.BPS refers to the biophysical setting that was predicted to exist before current times. EVT Represents existing vegetation types. This chord diagram shows the change between the previously predicted and existing habitat types.
